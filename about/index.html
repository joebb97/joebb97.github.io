<p><em>(Identities should not decide who gets to have an opinion and who does not, but they sure as shit can help us define the power dynamics in the discourse surrounding those opinions. Hence why I write the disclaimer below, and why most other men ought to consider a similar sentiment.)</em></p>
<p>First, I&rsquo;d like to acknowledge that as a cis-gendered, straight, white man, I am incredibly blessed and privileged to have lived the life I have. I have watched lots of Ru Paul&rsquo;s drag race and loved most every minute of it, but what gets me the most is the TOUGH time most of those Queens had growing up.</p>
<p>I am fortunate to have grown up in Ann Arbor, MI and attended public schools that are well funded and have a diverse student body. I am immensely proud of the fact that I attended only publicly funded schools and that I am where I&rsquo;m at today. I view it as proof that a community, dare I say even a country, that values public education for all its children can do incredible good for this world. I suppose you parochial and private school kids are fine too, but let&rsquo;s just have one school that does it right that costs no money m&rsquo;kay?</p>
<p>I attribute any success I have to the fact that I had a stable upbringing, two wonderful and successful parents who I look up to as role-models,
and a strong network of people supporting me along my journey in life. Knowing where your next meal is coming from and avoiding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue" rel="noopener" target="_blank">decision fatigue</a>
 can go a long way for a kid + their family.</p>
<p>That being said I am also pretty amazing, particularly at being humble and keeping my hubris in check. And at cracking jokes. It&rsquo;s my life goal to make you laugh. You silly billy.</p>
<p>It makes very happy to see the progress that society is making towards both equality and equity. Yes, some people are pedantic about the difference between those words. To me it&rsquo;s all the same cloth that it&rsquo;s cut from. We are being vocal about what we know is wrong and by golly it&rsquo;s gonna get better. It better!</p>
<h1 id="my-overall-interests">My Overall Interests</h1>
<p>(No particular order, but I suppose Technology comes first since it is my profession!)</p>
<ul>
<li>Technology - Computers and all facets of them. Meaningfully improving the lives of others con las computadoras.</li>
<li>Music - theory, production, classical, hip hop, jazz, piano, saxophone, whatever the hipsters do not listen to (yes, I am anti-anti-culture)</li>
<li>Empathy - volunteering, outreach, social change, compassion, teaching, DEI improvement and climate improvement at school and at work.</li>
<li>Activity - band, basketball, frisbee, lifting, friends, watching sports (especially Umich!), videogames. Get moving America! Listen to Michelle Obama!</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="my-values">My Values</h1>
<ul>
<li>Well, you already saw Empathy</li>
<li>Humor
<ul>
<li>One of my favorite Computer Scientists, maybe even people to witness walk this blue earth, is <a href="https://mickens.seas.harvard.edu/wisdom-james-mickens" rel="noopener" target="_blank">James Mickens</a>
. Holy shit is that man funny, and he&rsquo;s a Umich grad, GO BLUE!</li>
<li>Here&rsquo;s a nice little quote from him on a Reddit thread I don&rsquo;t feel like looking for. &ldquo;[Unless] you’re directly helping to end war, poverty, and homelessness at the same time, you don’t have the right to be ultra-serious.&rdquo;</li>
<li>^A sentiment I couldn&rsquo;t agree with more. Us technologists really do pat ourselves on the back too much. Most software is poop and actively hampers the mental health of the regular citizens of this blue planet. Let&rsquo;s get it right instead of lying to ourselves about how good or smart we are!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ethics
<ul>
<li>Please Jesus H.W Christ don&rsquo;t be a snake in how you view technology. Technology, while a convenient avenue for making money, can have very serious reprecussions in how it affects living, breathing humans. Put aside that silly little fiat currency that can&rsquo;t actually dig you a hole for just one second and think of any consequences your, &ldquo;move fast and break things&rdquo; mentality might have on thy neighbor. I&rsquo;m gonna spill a little secret here in that Tau Beta Pi has this saying they utter at you when you get initiated.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Of a profession, The foundation, Wholly free from reproach.&rdquo; And why that&rsquo;s a secret I have no idea, because it really is common sense.</li>
<li>Have a read over this <a href="https://ethics.acm.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here code of ethics</a>
 at least, and THEN go make it harder for those with darker skin tones to use your product @apple .</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Efficacy
<ul>
<li>I will never be a mediocre engineer. And if I am, or if I am told that I am, which I hope to any God some manager tells me, I will rectify that sitch immediately. This ties into ethics. We must be good at what we do, otherwise we are not helping the world with our engineering. Also, &ldquo;good at what we do&rdquo; does not imply you must know everything. I do not wish to instill any imposter syndrome here. We&rsquo;re allowed to learn along the way. But the crux does fall on engineers to deliver a <strong>functioning, beneficial piece of technology</strong> that makes people&rsquo;s lives better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learning
<ul>
<li>I have a strong desire to learn all areas of critical importance to computer systems which span a diverse collection of niches. I&rsquo;m very excited to contribute to these spaces, both in research and in practice, in my lifetime as a Computer Professional.</li>
<li>Compilers, Programming Languages, Networks, Operating Systems, Machine Learning, Computer Theory, Cryptography, there are many many many more niches. I&rsquo;m a life long learner. We all should be. No one person can learn all of this, but I sure can have fun trying!</li>
<li>We all should adopt a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve" rel="noopener" target="_blank">growth mindset</a>
 (watch the talk and read the book, it&rsquo;s fantastic!). We can learn what we want to learn. All it takes is time, sometimes money, and always some effort.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
