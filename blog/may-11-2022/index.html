    miss me with some       assembly language.

miss me with some

    I = {x86, CISC},

That. I = {x86, CISC}. Am. is not for humans.
{amd64, x86}               is not for humans.

  Yes. amd64 == x86_64. Fun fact.
  In general, amd64 == x86. History!

ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) is almost, but not quite, for humans,

  &#34;RISC&#34; == Reduced Instruction Set Computer.
  Yes. That&#39;s what ARM stands for. Fun Fact.

<p>I am a human. And I don&rsquo;t read assembly because. Well.
I am not a <em>literally</em> spineless, brainless piece of silicon.
I function outside the constraints of a digitally oscillating nanofabricated clock.</p>
<p>I am not an analog clock. One breathing with actual electricity. That clock. Does not think.
It { adds, divides, subtracts, multiplies } at the speed of GHz.
Billions of times per second (<em>literally</em>).</p>
<p>Do not. Try to equate my brain with that poopy-doodoo robot brain called
{ siri, alexa, google voice assistant }. That is, total nonsense! Donald Knuth.
Here&rsquo;s what should probably happen.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>START:
DO:
    while(bad code || sad || unproductive) {
SIMPLE: write POSIX shell, KISS, use simple plaintext

/* [1] A real academic, robust, &#34;enterprise ready&#34; programming language.
* There are many to choose from. But they are *not*. **NOT**.
* ABSOLUTELY NOT { 
    python{
      2, 2.7. 3.3, 3.7. 3.9, /etc.
    }
    (notReallyJava)Script (this one should really be JavaShit),
    TypeScript,
    Ruby
 }
* I say these languages aren&#39;t &#34;enterprise ready&#34; because.
* They were not designed. Adequately.
* For the problems we try to apply them to, such as {
    banking,
    ecommerce,
    social media,
    military,
    embedded devices (
        like Belkin&#39;s worthless &#39;digital light switches!
        it should just be a light switch. not a computer.
        change my mind. you probably won&#39;t
    ), // end embedded devices
    Smart TVs (
        seriously most of these things are giant pieces of garbage.
        Because well. 
        I&#39;m gonna guess there&#39;s some really unperformant
        interpreted [i.e slower, that is a fact, not an opinion],
            {dynamic, duck, weakly}-typed langs in there.
    ) // end SMART TVs
* } // end &#34;for the problems&#34;
} // end ABSOLUTELY NOT
* 
* INSTEAD. I say the languages we should learn towards are:
*    - Compiled.
*    - Strongly Typed.
*    - (Sometimes, but not required) Statically Typed.
*    - Safe by default. Footguns are opt-in, not opt-out.
*    - (Sometimes, depending on the domain) Light on syntax.
*    - Mostly performant out of the box.
*       &gt; You normally get this by just having a fucking compiler
          and the decades of research that comes with one.
          Blessed be thy LLVM and WASM in the future.
*    - Well researched. Well designed.
        &gt; they have means of reducing boilerplate. like generics.
          error propagation, etc.
*    - Can do any I/O. Lol. Simon Peyton-Jones said in a talk that Haskell
       used to struggle with this at one point. No longer!
       It has I/O, concurrency, async, and it&#39;s all pretty great!
*
* Some that I&#39;ve come across that fit this bill:
*    - Haskell
*    - Elm
*    - OCaml
*    - Elixir 
*    - Rust
*    - Scala (?)
*    - Julia (?)
* (?) implies that I&#39;m just going out on a limb since I don&#39;t know for sure

They just want me to write</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>every other line, which means it violates the points, <em>well researched and well designed</em>, and <em>safe by default</em>.</p>
<p>Nor am I trying to say that we shouldn&rsquo;t use the interpreted languages from the long list above. I&rsquo;d just like to not see javascript running my bank&rsquo;s frontend. Is all I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>The field of PL research (whose papers I absolutely have not read btw) has come a loooong way since those grey beards concocted a kernel worth two shits at Bell Labs. Called UNIX. With the forward slashes and what not.</p>
<p>Most of the research has yielded a loooot of niceties. Such as enums that are really enums (sum types I believe they&rsquo;re called) and not just a silly increasing number. Lookin&rsquo; at you <strong>Golang and C++</strong>. Rust and Haskell have beautiful enums that can each carry their own data, that way you don&rsquo;t accidentally use the wrong data.</p>
<p>And of course they have composition / structures / product types (I think is what they&rsquo;re called). But python sure as shit didn&rsquo;t until 3.7 when it added <code>datatype</code>.</p>
<p>Just. Ask more of your languages. Especially if you are going to be using them. Every. Single. Day of the week and for most projects at your {research lab, computer company, shitty web service}. Stop defensive programming with lines of code like</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>if (thingy != nil &amp;&amp; typeof thingy == typeIWantThingyToBe) {
    // Oh thank fucking god now I can actually use thingy without
    // worrying about this Stinger missle imploding.
    // Since it could be there&#39;s some proprietary garbage
    // language without type safety running in a Stinger missle
    // for all we know
}

</span></span></span></code></pre></div>And if that&rsquo;s too verbose for ya. Check out Haskell. It&rsquo;s like Python but better in every way, including having farrrr fewer parentheses than most languages ever have.</li>
<li>Inheritance sucks!
<ul>
<li>Yes it does! None of the languages I recommended above make you practice that
trash pattern from the late 90s. Some don&rsquo;t even support it whatsoever!</li>
<li>Composition/structures are me and <a href="https://rust-for-rustaceans.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jon Gjengsent</a>
&rsquo;s spirit animals.
Dynamic dispatch is nice and also achievable without. Shitty. Inheritance that looks something like
<ul>
<li><code>Handler -&gt; WebHandler -&gt; ApiHandler -&gt; ApiV2Handler -&gt; ThingThatAlmostDoesHTTP -&gt; ThingThatActuallyDoesHTTP</code>
and it juuust gets worse from there.</li>
